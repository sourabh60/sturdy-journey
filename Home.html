    <p>The Royal Challengers Bangalore (often abbreviated as RCB) are a franchise cricket team based in Bangalore, Karnataka, that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL). It was founded in 2008 by United Spirits and named after the company's liquor brand Royal Challenge. Since its inception, the team has played its home matches at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.

The Royal Challengers have never won the IPL but finished runners-up on three occasions between 2009 and 2016. Their lack of success over the years despite the presence of various notable players has earned them the tag of "underachievers". <br> <br><br>
        Royal Challengers Bangalore, also known as RCB, is the Bangalore based cricket franchise of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The team is owned by United Spirits Limited, a Diageo Group company. RCB rose from a bottom-two finish in 2008 to end as runners up in 2009 and semi-finalists in 2010. The team had 3 good seasons back-to-back when they made it to the final in 2011. Led by Virat Kohli, Royal Challengers Bangalore yet again finished 2nd in 2016. RCB has adopted the philosophy #PlayBold which resonates both on and off the field - ‘Defeats don’t defeat us, the Challenger Spirit keeps us alive’. <br> <br> <br>

Under the able leadership of Director of Cricket Operations Mike Hesson, Head Coach Simon Katich and captain Virat Kohli, RCB are gearing for the 2020 IPL season. The team has the experience of overseas stars like AB de Villiers, Aaron Finch, Dale Steyn, Chris Morris and Moeen Ali among others, while they have a strong Indian contingent under Virat Kohli to provide the necessary balance.  <br>
